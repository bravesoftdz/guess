Just a Pascal version of a "Guess the number" game I made on my VTech Pre Computer 1000 in BASIC as a kid.

It uses standard Pascal as much as possible, so it should be compilable on just about anything (the exception is the subroutines for random numbers, not defined in any standard, but widely implemented in compilers).
